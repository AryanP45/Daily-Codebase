# [A. Halloumi Boxes](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1903/A)

```
Theofanis is busy after his last contest, as now, he has to deliver many halloumis all over the world. He stored them inside n
 boxes and each of which has some number ai
 written on it.

He wants to sort them in non-decreasing order based on their number, however, his machine works in a strange way. It can only reverse any subarray†
 of boxes with length at most k
.

Find if it's possible to sort the boxes using any number of reverses.

†
 Reversing a subarray means choosing two indices i
 and j
 (where 1≤i≤j≤n
) and changing the array a1,a2,…,an
 to a1,a2,…,ai−1,aj,aj−1,…,ai,aj+1,…,an−1,an
. The length of the subarray is then j−i+1
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and k
 (1≤k≤n≤100
) — the number of boxes and the length of the maximum reverse that Theofanis can make.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the number written on each box.

Output
For each test case, print YES (case-insensitive), if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order, or NO (case-insensitive) otherwise.
