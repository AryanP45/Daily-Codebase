```java
while (currentSum + k < (long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1)) {
                currentSum -= nums[left]; // Adjust the subarray sum by removing the leftmost element
                left++; // Move the left pointer to the right
            }
```
This code runs fine .. but why we need to typecast  `(long) nums[right]` it works without it  
only gives wrong output in single case [1,1,1......] nums.length = 30000 and k=1  
answer should be 29999 but giving 30000.

GTP : In your specific case, where you have an array of all 1s with a length of 30000 and k=1, the multiplication (long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1) is less likely to cause an overflow due to the small values involved.

what might be the reason for failing that specific case ??
