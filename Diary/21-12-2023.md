> Version 1
```java
 class Solution {

        // calculating distance between two points is (x1-x2)
        // i have to find the max distance

        // approach 1
        // make an array of x co ordinates and sort it 
        // calculate the max difference betn these points and return it
        int mwova = 0;
        int x[] = new int[points.length];
        for(int i=0;i<points.length;i++){
