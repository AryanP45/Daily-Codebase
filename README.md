# Daily Code Log

This is a repository where I keep a daily log of the code that I submit to different coding platforms. This log serves as a way to track my progress, identify areas for improvement, and share my experiences with others.

## Structure

The repository is organized into daily logs, with each log representing a single day. Within each daily log, I include the following information:

- The date
- The coding platforms that I submitted code to (with problem link)
- The problems that I solved or the projects that I worked on
- Any insights or reflections that I have about it / Alternate Approach

## Usage

Feel free to use this repository as a source of inspiration for your own coding journey. You can browse through my daily logs to see the problems that I've solved, the platforms that I've used, and the insights that I've gained.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or feedback about my daily logs, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
